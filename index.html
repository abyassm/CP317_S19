      <p>Investing in a rice cooker is a good idea as you can buy a 20 lb bag of rice at Wal Mart for about 18 or so dollars. There are a lot of meals you can do with rice, cooking eggs with rice is great. A quick google search will show you just how many options are out there with rice being the foundation of the meal. You can also use the rice cooker to cook noodles quickly. Hope this helps! I remember what it’s like to be in college and scraping by.</p>

    <h2>why we cook</h2>
    <p> Cooking food does several things.

It kills harmful bacteria, fungi, and parasites in the food. This makes if safer to eat and is vitally important in a society that eats food days or weeks after it has been killed or gathered rather than minutes.

It starts the breakdown process of proteins and other components in the food making it easier to digest. This means we get more nutrients and spend less energy getting them which is very beneficial.

It alters the flavor of food to something that most people prefer.

Use of fire and eating of meat was something that occurred before humans as a species existed. Our pre human ancestors had started eating meat and developed many tools including the use of fire. At some point someone put meat near a fire and it cooked and they liked it, so the group kept doing that. That group got sick less often and got more nutrition from the food so they did better and grew larger, passing the skills down the generations..</p>
